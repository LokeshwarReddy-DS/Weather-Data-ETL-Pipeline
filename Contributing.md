# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution. A few guidelines to make collaboration smooth:

- Use a short, focused branch name (e.g. feat/add-transform, fix/bug-typo).
- Run tests locally before opening a pull request: pytest
- Keep changes small and include tests for new behavior when possible.
- Use ruff/black for formatting and add type hints where it helps clarity.
- Describe the purpose of your PR and list important design decisions in the PR body.
